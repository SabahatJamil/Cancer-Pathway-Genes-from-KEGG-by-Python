# Cancer-Pathway-Genes-from-KEGG-by-Python

This repository contains Python code for filtering cancer-related genes from the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway database. The goal is to identify genes associated with cancer within the context of biological pathways defined by KEGG.

KEGG Pathway Data Retrieval:
Utilize the KEGG API or download KEGG pathway data to access information on genes associated with various pathways.

Cancer Gene Identification:
Implement a script to filter out genes specifically associated with cancer pathways. This could involve parsing pathway information and identifying genes related to cancer.

Data Processing and Output:
Process the filtered genes and output the results in a format that facilitates further analysis or exploration.
